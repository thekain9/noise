## 🎨 Project Overview

This application was created to showcase Nebulox, an innovative set of headphones. The developer combined their skills in 3D modeling and web development to create an immersive and interactive product experience.

### 🖌️ 3D Modeling
The headphones were meticulously crafted using Blender and Octane, resulting in high-quality 3D models that form the centerpiece of the website.

### 🌐 Dynamic Website
The 3D models were exported and integrated into a dynamic website, allowing users to:
- Interact with the product in real-time
- Explore different color options
- View detailed product visualizations

### 🔄 State Management
Redux is employed for state management, enabling the application to:
- Save user purchase preferences
- Provide a seamless shopping experience

### 🗄️ Backend Integration
While the current version focuses on frontend interactions, the developer has laid the groundwork for future scalability:
- A Node.js backend is ready for integration
- GraphQL is set up to efficiently manage and store user preferences
